## About
```
It all started when I was on my Zumba class managed by our subdivision leaders. We were having issues on checking announcements from facebook messenger group chat because some random messages causes the chat group to look like a bombarded chat. Because of that, most of us are tired to scroll up and down to look for each instructor's announcement. I thought it would be nice to have a website for our community where our teachers will post their available schedules.
